# About
I've been doing Darwin Reverse Engineering since 2013 until around 2020. Now I've quit RE for the most part, and instead focus on working with LLVM.
I spend spare time submitting all kinds of patches to LLVM upstream:
- [D137700](https://reviews.llvm.org/D137700)
- [D138641](https://reviews.llvm.org/D138641)
- [D141256](https://reviews.llvm.org/D141256)
